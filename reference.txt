# Title

# Heading 1 {#heading-1}


## Heading 2 {#heading-2}


### Heading 3 {#heading-3}

This is a line with no formatting

This line has _italics _in it

This line has **bold** in it

This line has **_bold italics_** because I am curious

This is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">underlined</span>

This has ~~strikethrough~~ because I like that one

This has <sup>superscript</sup> and <sub>subscript</sub> text

This has an [internal link](#heading-2) and an [external one](https://catgirl.software/~emma/resume)

I might want a cool dividing line?
